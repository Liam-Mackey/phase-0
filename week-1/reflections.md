#header for Think About Time
There were three time/productivity management ideas that I learned about that I felt would be truly helpful. The first was mindfulness which is something I am already very passionate about. I feel that if I practice mindfulness more I will be able to handle the stress of heavy workloads better, i.e. I will be able to detach from the stress and analyze it rationally. The second was the idea of tiny habits. I have great habits when it comes to school work so I don't anticipate many problems there but I could lose some weight and eat better. So i plan to use the tiny habits Idea to help me lose weight by starting out with something small like adding an extra five minutes to my workout everyday, or eating a salad instead of a sandwich for lunch on Tuesdays and Fridays. If i better my health my productivity should increase as well. Lastly i learned about the Pomodoro technique, which i plan to implement more often.

I like the idea of time boxing, or setting time limits for a task then evaluating it when the time is up. Time boxing is an effective tool for increasing productivity because it helps you analyze if you are being productive, and lets you realize if need to take a break because you are stuck. The problem with that for me is I have a very hard time taking breaks. I like to work until i accomplish my task no matter how long it takes. I rarely take breaks either. That is why I plan to use the pomodoro technique more. I manage my time currently by working until there is no more work to do for the day. This makes me get stuff in on time but I feel that it sometimes burns e out and decreases the quality of my work. Therefore I feel my current time management skills could be improved. I plan to employ the pomodoro technique as well as the tiny habits technique to improve my productivity, particularly the quality of work i produce. 

My plan for phase 0 is to wake up early and get as much work done as i can before i go to work. Then when I return home as night to continue working until 8 or 9 or until  get a reasonable amount of work done. I will also be implementing the pomodoro technique by setting a timer on my phone, as well as time boxing so i will know if i have spent to much time working on a task and need to take a break. 
##header for Command line
This exercise was very fun, it made me feel like a real programmer. Reflecting on it now I find it amazing how much I learned in a small amount of time. I now understand how to use the terminal on my mac. I also know how to quickly navigate through and display files on my computer.

A shell is a term used to refer to a user interface on a computer. Almost all computers nowadays have Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Prior to this invention computers used Command Line Interface (CLI), this is what shell is. the Unix shell works by receiving typed commands and then interpreting through a language called ‘bash’. Bash is the language the shell uses to determine what action the user wants the computer to take. The unix shell and its language bash were released in 1989 and then became the default language for linux and OSX.

The hardest thing for me to do in this challenge was to copy a file from my desktop to the temp folder using shell. I tried and tried but had trouble. So I decided to look for help, but the website that we were given didn’t seem to help. Then finally I looked online and found the answer. My issue was I want specifying where in my computer I wanted the file to go. I finally got it after about ten minutes. It was confusing at first  but then extremely rewarding to complete.

I was successful in using all of the commands. I found that each one that I used and became familiar with made me more confident that i could use the next one properly. This exercise was thoroughly rewarding.

The most important commands to know have to be help, man, and apropos. These commands in theory allow someone with little to no knowledge of bash successfully communicate with the computer. What i mean by this is that a user new to bash could use anyone of these commands to help them figure out what command they want and what to do next. That, in my opinion is one of bash’s greatest features.

-pwd = tells you what folder you are in, i.e “Prints working directory”
-ls = lists all of the contents of the directory you're in.
-mv = moves files
-cd = changes the current directory you are in
-../ = changes current directory by moving you up the tree path  you’re in
-touch = creates new (empty) files
-mkdir = makes a new directroy
-less = allows you to view a file page by page
-rmdir = removes a directory
-rm = removes a file
-help = helps you figure out what command you are looking for, i.e lists all the most common commands.
###header for Forking and Cloning
Instructions for forking and cloning a git repository:

Log on to Github.com
Find the repository you want to fork
Click on the word fork in the upper right hand corner
Once the repository has been forked copy the https clone url
Get into the directory that you want to be in
Then in your terminal write “git clone ” and then paste your url
Then you are done
To add a new repository simply modify steps 2 and 3 to be

Click the + sign in the upper right hand corner
Choose a name and preferences for your repository
Then continue with steps 4-7 as above

 

The main reason to fork a repository is to add to the code. If you created a whole new repository you would not have access to the code being worked on in the forked repository by others. Forking a repository allows you to copy the pre-existing code in the repository and then add on to it. By doing this many people can work on the same code.

When setting up github and git I struggled with getting the proper syntax for git commands like git init or git add . these commands were confusing at first but after a while i succeeded in getting a good grasp on them.
