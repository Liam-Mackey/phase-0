#Describe what open source means.
Open source is basically just like a library. depending on the type of licensing you may have access to all the code made by one developer. This is great for furthering the coding advancemnet of society. If you want to make money of your code however you are in for some trouble. Open Source licenses basically allow anyone to use or modify your code, however some licenses have certain protections like the GNU or Apache license.

#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think open sourec sounds just like a utopian coder community. That is untill you want to make money. I am excited about having access to large amounts of code that i can modify using open source. It sounds awesome. I am all about sharing ideas, thats how people and societies grow.

#Assess the importance of using licenses.
It is important to use a license to have at least some protection. Open Souce licenses vary but most of them still leave you with the copyright for the original code. That is important. If your employer ever wanted to see work you had done you should have a license on it to prove its yours. License's also help you specify what you want to get out of your code. They help you enfore the rules you want around your code.

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
The concepts surrounding using git to track files, commit them, and push them were really solidified for me by doing this assignment. It reallly helped me get to better understand how to use git and the terminal. I had no major issues with this assignment.

#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
