#My Site Map
![Site-map](https://github.com/Liam-Mackey/phase-0/blob/master/week-2/imgs/site-map.jpg?raw=true)
It should be noted that I am not putting my Picture and links to my social media profiles in the site-map, because I was planning on putting my picture on the home page and having the links to my social media be on the nav bar of the home page. Also I don't think it is nessecary to make a whole page for social media pages.

#What are the 6 phases of web design?
The six phases of we design are: 
1. Information Gathering: Taking into account Goals, Purpose, Target Audience, and Content.

2. Planning: Making a site map.

3. Design: Using wire frames to help come up with a picture of the final website.

4. Development: Using code to build the website.

5. Testing: Test your site to make sure it works properly and recieve feedback from users.

6. Maintenance: Constantly keeping your site up to date and adding new features.

#What will my site feature?
My site will feature info about me. The main goal of my site will be to help me get a job. That is why it is kind of structured like a resume. The purpose of the site is to give my employer the information he needs to know about me as well as demonstrate my web development and design skills.

#What is the primary action the user should take when visiting my site?
The main action the user should take when viewing my site is to view my credentials and be able to effectivley contact me. Searching for blog posts would be a lesser thing they could do as well.

#The main things you should know about web design and User experience:
Designing a website around user expereince is incredibly important. The user is going to visit your site and ask themsekves "Is it easy to use?", "Is it good looking?", "Does it appeal to me?" etc. If they say no to too many or even one of these questions then they are not comming back to your site. In a world where websites are all being designed around user expereince if yours isn't the  you are in for some real trouble. You should know about proper usage of fonts and color schemes. You should know your target audience and cater your site design towards them. You should also consider usability is your site easy to use and does it flow well when the user wants to preform his or her task. 

#What is UX design and why is it important?
UX design is crucial to maintaining visitors to your website. User Experience (UX) design is focused around how the user feels about the site. Is it easy to use? Is it pretty? Does it appeal to me? When so many other sites on the web cater to users if yours doesn't then people will use other sites. We have to consider how the user feels if we want to maintain users.

#Navigating and linking Resources
I was effectivley able to navigate to and link to new resources i.e.(../) without research. I am really getting the hang of git and Shell. I was able to navigate around my terminal fairly easily. Or at least much easier than last time. I am trying to use git and githb as much as i can to get the hang of it better.

#What was the hardest part of this challenge?
The hardest part of this challenge for me was making the site map. I am not that great of an artist and all of the online site map tools you had to pay to use them and I wasn't ready for that just yet. But I like to think I did a good job, next time I might use something like paint though instaed of pen and paper.
