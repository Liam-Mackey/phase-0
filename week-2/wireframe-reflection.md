#What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a mockup of what a website or webapp will look like. it is used to help web developers and designers create websites that are visually appealing and allow for a enjoyable customer experience. A wireframe is like a skeleton for a website. There are wireframes and hi-def wireframes. Hi-def wireframes are used to further plan the website. They often times will get more in-depth and add interactive features and colors. Wireframes are not meant to be pretty,  although that doesn’t mean they can't be, they are meant to be the bones that you will build your html and css around. The wireframes are the bones, the html are the muscles, and the css is the skin and clothes. Wireframing is incredibly important.

#What are the benefits of wireframing?
The benefits of wireframing are like the benefits of outlining your essay or making cards for your speech.  Wireframing gives you a framework to build upon. wireframes also help you come up with ideas and plan instead of jumping straight into code which is more likely to lead to failure. Wireframing makes it easier to make changes to your website because you have a model t go back and look at while you decide what to alter. Wireframes also help developers and designers make their websites more user friendly and easier to navigate.

#Did I enjoy wireframing my site?
I did enjoy wireframing my site, I just wish I was a better artist or that the online wireframe sites were free. What I enjoyed most about the wireframing was that it reminded me of printmaking and setting up your linoleum templates and then I adding the html and the css will be like running it through the press. 

#Did I revise my wireframe?
I did revise my wireframe specifically the nav bar. I revised it to include more tabs for links to more sites like github and linkedin. I also revised my blog page to include a more detailed drawing. It will have a title for each post then it will be described underneath.

#What questions did I ask during this challenge? What were the answers?
The questions I asked had to do with how to setup a basic wireframe. I did find a website that helped me. I did some research to help me figure out how to make a basic wireframe.

#What was hardest for me?
The most tedious part of this challenge for me was the drawing. i really haven't sketched or drawn on paper since high  school. The planning behind the drawing was very fun however. I can’t wait to flesh out my page with some CSS.
