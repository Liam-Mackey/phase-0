- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was fun and exciting working with marshall we had a great time. We learned a lot about html and how to translate our learning into a concrete website. It was very enlightening.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was a bit of a challenge but we got the hang of it after doing some research on HTML5 tags and practicing them.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We didn't format anything and we used HTML5 Elements. We madde short and sweet commit messages.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
It is a great way to oragnize a webpage but to someone who is not familliar with it it can be a pain. HTML5 is great for screen readers and formating, but there is more to memorize.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I try to think about structure more than format. I also use the acronym HTML as Head Title Main Last to help me remember the format.
