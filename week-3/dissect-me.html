What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I have always used the header and nav tags within my body to give my web page a nice navigation bar as well as to help create a clearly defined page title for the web page. I also always use the section tag because I want to make my web page easier to understand for people using screen readers and people retrieving data from my web page. Section and article give the page a nice layout for people who are using screen readers. I tend to try to not use so many divs but I do think it is incredibly important to recognize how certain html5 elements are being phased in to replace the excessive usage of divs. It is important to consider that these elements behave like divs and can be used instead of divs in many situations.
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements get laid out on the page using the Document Object Model (DOM) which sets up a tree for the elements which the web browser then translates into a web page. The elements are displayed in descending order starting with the html tag. Only body elements will be visible but the head elements are displayed first because they come first. It is like climbing a tree where the opening html tag is the trunk.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I learned how to create sublime snippets which are like text shortcuts for sublime. I learned that sublime is a dynamic system that allows for user created shortcuts, which I think is pretty cool. I will definitely create more snippets if I feel the need to, I might create one for my blog template that way I won't have to always copy and paste the template. I will also definitely do more research on shortcuts that already exist.

        <p>Well for starters Margin, Border, and Padding are key:value pairs that are used in CSS, a web design language, to help determine the dimensions of content.</p>
        <p>Before I go into the detailed web design description of the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding let me give you an example: Imagine we are moving a very delicate antique vase that our Depression era grandmother gave us. It is her pride and joy. So obviously we want to be very careful with it. The vase itself represents what we call content in CSS, that could be a paragraph, image, heading etc.. The bubble wrap we put around the vase, to keep it from touching the inside of the box, is representative of the Padding key:value pair in CSS. The box itself is what we would call a border in CSS. It is effectively the end of the extension of our content. We can make the border thin or thick just like we can use a thick wooden box or a thin cardboard box. Lastly, we wouldn’t want to put Nana’s vase near any other heavy items in the moving truck because they could fall on it and smash it. The space separating our box from other boxes represents the Margin key:value pair. That’s a very basic explanation of how Margin, Border, and Padding determine the dimensions of and spaces in-between content in CSS.</p>
