// Reflection
/*

What was the most difficult part of this challenge?
Coming up with an awesome story! Nah just kidding that was easy the hardest part was making sure that all my syntax was correct this was along program.
What did you learn about creating objects and functions that interact with one another?
I learned that it is relativley easy pass functions between objects. You just call te object the a dot then its function.
Did you learn about any new built-in methods you could use in your refactored solution? If so, what were they and how do they work?
Most of my solution was simplc code it was just a lot of it I did learn how to use the this object though which is basically the same as self in ruby. It refers to the current object. I also refactored my code for dryness.
How can you access and manipulate properties of objects?
You can use dot notation or bracket notation outside of the object but you can also use literal notation inside the object.
