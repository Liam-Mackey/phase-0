#What does puts do?

puts outputs a string to the console and then adds a new line as opposed to prints.

#What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole number examples are 0, -1, 100. These numbers do not have decimals in them. A float is a number with at least on decimal place. 

#Hours in a Year Program

```
hours = 24 * 365

puts hours

```

#Minutes in a Decade Program

```
minutes = 60 * 24 * ((365*10) + 2)

puts minutes

```
#How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby handles this similar to how a calculator would. However with division you need to convert your numbers to floats otherwise you will get an integer division answer. There are also some other cool methods for numbers in ruby such as the modulus, which determines the remainder when dividing two numbers and integer division, which returns the rounded down number after division.

#What is the difference between integers and floats?

Integers are whole numbers where as floats are numbers that have decimals in them.

#What is the difference between integer and float division?

Integer division rounds down the result and float division will give you an exact answer, except for repeating decimals, With floats you can specify how many decimals you want in your answer.

#What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are basically a string of characters that can be used to represent something, like a word or name. Strings are very useful because they allow us to store words and other non numeric values in programs. Also strings have some pretty cool methods like reverse, split, and downcase. 

#What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local variables are variables that have a specific scope. For example they are used within the program, code block, class, or method alone. They are the opposite of global variables which can be used anywhere. Local variables are started with an underscore or lowercase letter. They represent the variables used in this challenge.
